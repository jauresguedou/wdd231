        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>
          To give our trendy shoes website a luxury, premium, elegant vibe, we've selected the following  key colors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Primary Color: Deep Navy</strong>
            <br /><em>Usage:</em> Gives a refined, sophisticated tone and replaced plain black with a more stylish, deep tone. Sets the luxurious atmosphere without being overwhelming. It will be used for 
             the footer background , the primary branding elements , the nav bar background.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secondary Color: Gold</strong>

I will be used to highlight elements like "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now" buttons. Small icons, underlines, or borders. Hover effects for links or call to actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accent Color: Cream White</strong>
